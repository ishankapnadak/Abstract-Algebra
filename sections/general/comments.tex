\section*{Updates/Corrections}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item `Well-definedness' of even/odd permutations
    \item Order of $A_n$ for $n=1$?
    \item Show that $H = \{1, g^{\pm 1}, g^{\pm 2}, \ldots \}$ is indeed a group and that any group containing $g$ must contain $H$ (subgroup generated by $g$)
    \item show that for an infinite, cyclic group, $x^{-1}$ is indeed a generator
    \item Homomorphism properties - $f$ is bijective + homom $\implies$ $f^{-1}$ is also homom
    \item (idk where to put this) order of $GL_n(\mathbb{F})$ for a finite field. Deduce order of $SL_n(\mathbb{F})$.
    \item Mobius inversion 
    \item Complete Fundamental Theorem of Algebra part
    \item Proof of theorem - units in $R[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
